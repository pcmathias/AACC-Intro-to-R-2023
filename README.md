# AACC Introduction to R Workshop - 2023

## Welcome!

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with little or no programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data.

-   Instructors:
    -   [Patrick Mathias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pcmathias/)
    -   [Amrom Obstfeld](https://www.chop.edu/doctors/obstfeld-amron)
    -   [Robert Benirschke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-benirschke/)

## Before you arrive

For the best experience, please have the following ready before the workshop begins:

-   You will need a laptop computer to access the exercises during the course.

-   We will use Posit (a.k.a. RStudio) Cloud as our training environment. Please sign up for a free account [here](https://Posit.cloud/).\*\*

-   Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as some [older browsers](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) may not be compatible with the RStudio application).

The workshop is scheduled to begin on Sunday, July 23, 2023 at 8:30AM Pacific Time. Please make every effort to arrive 10 - 15 minutes early to allow time to get settled and ensure your computer is set up.

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

1.  Course content will be pre-loaded in the RStudio instance that we will be working with on the day of the workshop and will be available for download there as a .zip file.
2.  The content is also available now at [our course github page](https://github.com/pcmathias/AACC-Intro-to-R-2023) and can be downloaded from there as well.

## Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our own cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. However, *in the long term*, you will need R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on private data. You can find step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)).

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences. The workshop also integrates content, best practices, and lessons from a variety of educators in the R community. We would like to specifically acknowledge:
